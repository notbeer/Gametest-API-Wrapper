<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There aren't many examples out there on this new feature 'GameTest'. I have made this to help you out and give you a solid example on what this new feature can be used for! This project includes a command handler in ES6, which is really easy to understand if you have the basic JS knowledge. I have left comments through out the project for you to understand what's going on better!

* This is basically a starter kit. You won't have to build your's from scratch, if you were planning to make custom commands.

* I have built you a custom command handler! So, you won't need to repeat your code over and over again.

* Built in event listeners. Making it easier for you to listen for events!

* The files/commands are very organized. This will make your navigations way easier.


### Built With

* [GameTest FrameWork](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/scriptapi/minecraft/minecraft)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Easy Method
* Download this zip folder and name it to .mcpack and import it by clicking on the file. This method will only world, if you have Minecraft Bedrock Edition in the same device you are doing this action on.

Recommended Method
* Another Method would be to take the zipped folder and unzip/extract it. Take you folder can move it to the folder 'development_behavior_packs', which can be found in a path like '_\Users\USER_NAME\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\development_behavior_packs_'. This will make your life way easier, while developing this pack. It will update the content inside your game everytime you make any changes to the script. For the changes to apply you must leave and rejoin your world where the pack is applied at.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/notbeer/MCBE-GameTest-FrameWork.git
   ```

## Usage

Most of the features should work as of now version 1.17.10. A lot of the class, methods, properties and more may change a lot. Since GameTest FrameWork is in heavy development as of now. 

<strong>WARNING: </strong>`If you are going to apply any GameTest related scripts to your world, please make a copy of your world before you do so! I'm not responsible if anything goes wrong-`


Create a new world, since GameTest FrameWork is still experimental. Make sure in your settings you have `GameTest FrameWork` enabled under `Experiments` category.
At last type in the game chat `+help` for the list of commands or `+help [command name]` to get information on a specific command! You can edit/add commands to the pack in the folder.
